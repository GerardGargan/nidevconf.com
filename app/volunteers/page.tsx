                Organised by practitioners, run by volunteers. Every year a crew of people from
                the tech community get together on Saturday to make the conference happen. If you’d like
                to volunteer in some capacity this year, let us know in the form below.
              </p>

                You’ll join a team of people who get it, and see the conference from another angle,
                behind the scenes of the event of the year for the tech community. Pink t-shirt
                included. It’s great craic.
